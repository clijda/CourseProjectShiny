However, \n# if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from\n# the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm\n# on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the\n# end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to\n# evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the\n# short time frame.  \n\nlibrary(shiny)\ndata(mtcars)\n\nshinyUI(pageWithSidebar(\n  \n  # Application title\n  headerPanel(\"mtcars scatterplots and regression analysis\"),\n  \n  # Sidebar with checkboxes for variables to plot\n  sidebarPanel(\n    checkboxGroupInput(\"Predictors\", \"Select minimum 2 variables: \",names(mtcars),selected=c(\"mpg\",\"cyl\")),\n    h4(helpText(\"How it works...\")),\n    helpText(\"The application builds a pairs plot and performs a short regression analysis based on the selected variables (at least 2) in the checkboxes.\"),\n    helpText(\"The outcome of the regression is always 'mpg', whether selected or not.\"),\n    helpText(\"The regression analysis consists of calculating RÂ² and determining the estimated values of the intercept and multipliers for the selected variables.\")\n  ),\n  \n  # Show a pairsplot of the selected predictors\n  mainPanel(\n    plotOutput(\"pairsPlot\"),\n    h3(textOutput(\"x\")),\n    textOutput(\"y\"),\n    textOutput(\"z\")\n  )\n))\n",
