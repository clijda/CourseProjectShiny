# This is the user-interface definition of a Shiny web application.
# You can find out more about building applications with Shiny here:

#

# Your Shiny Application
# 
# Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. 
# The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need 
# to get started using your application.
# Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
# Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
# Share your server.R and ui.R code on github
# The application must include the following:
# 
# Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
# Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
# Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
# You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could
# use your application.
# The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. 
# Do not post to an external link.
# The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, 
# if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from
# the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm
# on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the
# end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to
# evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the
# short time frame.
